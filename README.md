# ML-foundations
* This repository covers detailed explanations of **all Python libraries** which are essential for **Machine Learning**.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for an hands-on experience for how **data is pre-processed** before training into a ML model.
* Probablility concepts which are integral part of the **Math behind concepts** of Machine Learning.

## Build your concepts :scroll:
All these libraries forms the ground upon which everything is built in Machine Learning. One should follow this chronology in order to build the foundation step-by-step :-

### 1. Numpy 🔢
### 2. Pandas 🐼
### 3. Matplotlib 📊
### 4. Seaborn 📈
### 5. Sci-kit Learn 💻
### 6. Data Analysis (EDA) 📝
### 7. Probability (Extra Content) ⏳
